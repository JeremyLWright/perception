==================
=BMR's Wall Tiles=
==================

Version:      v3.0.5
Release Date: January 17, 2014


INTRODUCTION
============

BMR's Wall Tiles, or BMRWT, is a collection of different floor tiles
that can fit various settings and tilemaps.  BMRWT is a subsection of
BMRT (BMR Art).  While BMRT provides ready-assembled tilesets BMRWT
is instead a collection of different tiles that can be mixed and
matched however the game designer wants.

Starting with version 3, BMR's Wall Tiles is now in the Public Domain
rather than Creative Commons, meaning you don't have to attribute or
ask for permission or anything.  You can do anything you want with it.
If you do use it, it would be nice to drop me a line showing me where
you've used the graphics.  It's not necessary, but it would be nice.

Take note that BMRT tiles were originally created for use with the
OHRRPGCE.  This does not mean they cannot be used outside of the
engine though, and you should feel free to do whatever you want with
them.


STRUCTURE
=========

This set contains various walls segments that can be arranged and built
into just about any type of room.  Included are diagonal walls, columns,
and shadows for corners.

The first set, "bmrwalls000.png" is a base showing the lighting/shadows
that are applied to the different sets.  This will help give an idea as
to how the tiles work together.


IMPORTANT NOTES
===============

BMRWT does not use a specific palette.  This was done to better allow
individuals to tweak the colors to match whatever palette they are
using.  Each set is limited to only 16 colors, though I suppose they
could further be reduced to 8 while still retaining quality.
Reductions or expansions in color, however, I leave to the individual
game maker.  I might get around to it in the future, but don't keep
your hopes up.

Lastly, I don't make any assurances that these are optimized to use 
the fewest number of colors possible.  You're always free to modify 
these to whatever you want them to look like.


LICENCE INFORMATION
===================

BMRT by Lakan David D. Inocencio is in the public domain.

In a nutshell, you're free to use this tileset in pretty much 
whatever way you want, commercially or non-commercially.  If you 
want to modify an re-release this, you're free to do so.  If you
want to host it elsewhere, go for it.  Don't, however, go
claiming you made the entire set, that wouldn't be nice.  It's
in the public domain, so if you want to package it as part of an
art pack, include it in a commercial game, make money off it, then
go for it.
